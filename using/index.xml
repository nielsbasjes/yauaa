Some fields only require a handful of rules where others have a lot of them. This means that it depends on the fields that have been requested how many rules are kept in the system and thus how much memory is used to store the rules in. To get an idea of the relative memory impact of the rules needed for a specific field.</description></item><item><title>The demonstration webservlet</title><link>/using/webservlet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/using/webservlet/</guid><description>Part of the distribution is a war file that is a servlet that has a webinterface and some APIs that allow you to try things out.
This servlet can be downloaded via
&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;nl.basjes.parse.useragent&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;yauaa-webapp&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;6.5&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;war&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt; NOTE that this is a DEMONSTRATION servlet!
It is simply the library in a servlet, no optimizations or smart memory settings have been done at all.
Docker Starting with version 5.14.1 the webservlet is also published to the central docker registry.</description></item><item><title>Limitations</title><link>/using/limitations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/using/limitations/</guid><description>It only analyzes the provided string This system is based on analyzing the useragent string and looking for the patterns in the useragent string as they have been defined by parties like Google, Microsoft, Samsung and many others. These have been augmented with observations how developers apparently do things. There are really no (ok, very limited) lookup tables that define if a certain device name is a Phone or a Tablet.</description></item><item><title>Licence</title><link>/using/license/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/using/license/</guid><description>Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004 https://www.apache.org/licenses/
