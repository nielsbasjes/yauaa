# Security Policy

The Yauaa team takes security very seriously, and aim to resolve issues as quickly as possible. Building secure
software is a continuous process, and can always be improved. As such we welcome reports on potential security
vulnerabilities, as well as suggestions around hardening the software and our process.

## Reporting a suspected vulnerability

It is important that suspected vulnerabilities are disclosed in a responsible way, and are not publicly disclosed until
after they have been analysed and a fix is available.

To report a security vulnerability, send an email to yauaa-security@basjes.nl .

Do *not* open a public issue, send a pull request, or disclose any information about the suspected vulnerability publicly.
If you discover any publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities, please notify us *immediately* through
yauaa-security@basjes.nl .

## Supported Versions

Depending on the severity of a vulnerability the issue may be fixed in the current `major.minor.patch` release of Yauaa, or
for lower severity vulnerabilities or hardening in the following `major.minor.patch` release. Refer to
[the versions available on Maven central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/nl.basjes.parse.useragent/yauaa/7.30.0/versions) to find the latest release.

## Automatic updates

We strongly recommend using tool like [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com) or [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) to get the latest versions of all your dependencies automatically as a pull request in Github or Gitlab.
