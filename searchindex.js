My reasoning is that it is a system that someone uses to find security problems. With tools like this it is clear it is not a normal visitor that is interested in the content of the website. What is uncertain is the reason behind this: is it to fix problems or to abuse them?

Map\u003cString, String\u003e requestHeaders = new TreeMap\u003c\u003e(); requestHeaders.put(\"User-Agent\", \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua\", \"\\\" Not A;Brand\\\";v=\\\"99\\\", \\\"Chromium\\\";v=\\\"100\\\", \\\"Google Chrome\\\";v=\\\"100\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Arch\", \"\\\"x86\\\"\");

requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Model\", \"\\\"\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform\", \"\\\"Windows\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform-Version\", \"\\\"0.1.0\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Wow64\", \"?0\"); UserAgent userAgent = uaa.parse(requestHeaders); this results in (among other things)\nOperatingSystemNameVersion : 'Windows 7' AgentNameVersion : 'Chrome 100.0.4896.75' Although the User-Agent contains Windows NT 10.0 the (correct) answer provided by Yauaa is Windows 7 because this is the reduced User-Agent (all minor versions of Chrome are 0: 100.0.0.0) and the Client hints indicate Windows and 0.1.0.\nWhich client hints do I really need? A bit deeper dive into the fields and their “added value” and why to request and keep them (or not).\nGeneral considerations:\nThe first request only has the low entropy headers Sec-Ch-Ua, Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile and Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform. Only later requests can have more headers if requested and allowed. With the reduction/freeze of the useragents several parts are now static and no longer show correct values. This is most obvious are the version of the browser (only the major version), the device brand \u0026 name (absent on mobile) and the version of the operating system (i.e. always Windows 10.0, Android 10 or Mac OS X 10_15_7 ). This is where client hints do contain the correct values. Client hint Example Keep it? Why Sec-Ch-Ua \" Not A;Brand\";v=“99”, “Chromium”;v=“100”, “Google Chrome”;v=“100” Yes You may not have the Sec-Ch-Ua-Full-Version-List with the exact versions. Sec-Ch-Ua-Full-Version-List \" Not A;Brand\";v=“99.0.0.0”, “Chromium”;v=“100.0.4896.75”, “Google Chrome”;v=“100.0.4896.75” Yes Is the better variant of Sec-Ch-Ua but it may not be present. Sec-CH-Ua-Full-Version “100.0.4896.75” No This field is deprecated in the standard. Also this info is also present in the Sec-Ch-Ua-Full-Version-List. Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile ?0 Yes In the (very rare) case where we cannot determine if it is a phone or tablet this flag determines the end result. Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform “Windows” Yes Needed in the very common case of bad version info in the useragent. Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform-Version “0.1.0” Yes Needed in the very common case of bad version info in the useragent. This “0.1.0” means “Windows 7” because the Platform says “Windows”. Sec-Ch-Ua-Arch “x86” Yes The only way to determine a MacOS system is running an M1/M2 (ARM) instead of an Intel CPU Sec-Ch-Ua-Bitness “64” Yes Often not present in the useragent Sec-CH-UA-Form-Factor “Mobile” Yes New in the specification, in July 2023 no browsers supported this yet. Sec-Ch-Ua-Model “Nokia 7.2” Yes Often not present in the useragent (brand and device info). Sec-Ch-Ua-Wow64 ?0 No The only thing this says is that this is Windows (use Platform) and that it is 32 bit software running on a 64 bit system. To simplify it all I would\nAsk for all of them (regardless if I say No above) because the browsers are currently in flux in what they put in these fields. Persist all headers starting with Sec-Ch-Ua along with the User-Agent. The assumption is that later versions of browsers will change what they put in these fields which may yield possible analysis improvements.",

    "content": "Parsing Useragents Parsing useragents is considered by many to be a ridiculously hard problem. The main problems are:\nAlthough there seems to be a specification, many do not follow it. Useragents LIE that they are their competing predecessor with an extra flag. The pattern the ’normal’ browser builders are following is that they all LIE about the ancestor they are trying to improve upon.\nThe reason this system (historically) works is because a lot of website builders do a very simple check to see if they can use a specific feature.\nif (useragent.contains(\"Chrome\")) { // Use the chrome feature we need. } Some may improve on this an actually check the (major) version that follows.\nA good example of this is the Edge browser:\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2311.135 Safari/537.36 Edge/12.10136 It says it:\nis Mozilla/5.0 uses AppleWebKit/537.36 for “compatibility” the AppleWebKit lie about being “KHTML” and that it is similar to “Gecko” are also copied is Chrome 42 is Safari 537 is Edge 12 So any website looking for the word it triggers upon will find it and enable the right features.\nIn 2014 an RFC for HTTP was released (RFC 7231 section 5.5.3) which now explicitly states:\n... implementations are encouraged not to use the product tokens of other implementations in order to declare compatibility with them, as this circumvents the purpose of the field. … encouraged …\nHow many other analyzers work When looking at most implementations of analysing the useragents I see that most implementations are based around lists of regular expressions. These are (in the systems I have seen) executed in a specific order to find the first one that matches.\nIn this solution direction the order in which things occur determines if the patterns match or not.\nRegular expressions are notoriously hard to write and debug and (unless you make them really complex) the order in which parts of the pattern occur is fixed.\nCore design idea I wanted to see if a completely different approach would work: Can we actually parse these things into a tree and work from there.\nThe parser (ANTLR4 based) will be able to parse a lot of the agents but not all. Tests have shown that it will parse \u003e99% of all useragents on a large website which is more than 99.99% of the traffic.\nNow the ones that it is not able to parse are the ones that have been set manually to an invalid value. So if that happens we assume you are a hacker. In all other cases we have matchers that are triggered if a specific value is found by the parser. Such a matcher then tells this class is has found a match for a certain attribute with a certain confidence level (0-10000000). In the end the matcher that has found a match with the highest confidence for a value ‘wins’.\nHigh level implementation overview The main concept of this useragent parser is that we have two things:\nA Parser (ANTLR4) that converts the useragent into a nice tree through which we can walk along. A collection of matchers. A matcher triggers if a set of patterns is present in the tree. Each pattern is detected by a “matcher action” that triggers and can fill a single attribute. If a matcher triggers a set of attributes get set with a value and a confidence level All results from all triggered matchers (and actions) are combined and for each individual attribute the ‘highest value’ wins. As a performance optimization we walk along the parsed tree once and fire everything we find into a precomputed hashmap that points to all the applicable matcher actions. As a consequence\nthe matching is relatively fast even though the number of matchers already runs into the few hundreds. the startup is “slow” the memory footprint is pretty big due to the number of matchers, the size of the hashmap and the cache of the parsed useragents. A much more in depth explanation can be found in the documentation on how to create new rules",
    "description": "Parsing Useragents Parsing useragents is considered by many to be a ridiculously hard problem. The main problems are:\nAlthough there seems to be a specification, many do not follow it. Useragents LIE that they are their competing predecessor with an extra flag. The pattern the ’normal’ browser builders are following is that they all LIE about the ancestor they are trying to improve upon.\nThe reason this system (historically) works is because a lot of website builders do a very simple check to see if they can use a specific feature.",

The library has been published to maven central so that should work in almost any environment.\nIf you use a maven based project simply add this dependency to your project.\n\u003cdependency\u003e \u003cgroupId\u003enl.basjes.parse.useragent\u003c/groupId\u003e \u003cartifactId\u003eyauaa\u003c/artifactId\u003e \u003cversion\u003e7.28.1\u003c/version\u003e \u003c/dependency\u003e To actually use it in your application you need to create an instance of the UserAgentAnalyzer.\nPlease instantiate a new UserAgentAnalyzer as few times as possible because the initialization step for a full UserAgentAnalyzer (i.e. all fields) usually takes something in the range of 2-5 seconds and uses a few hundred MiB of memory to store all the analysis datastructures.\nThis analyzer can only do a single analysis at a time and to ensure correct working the main method is synchronized. If you have a high load you should simply create multiple instances and spread the load over those instances. When running in a framework (like Apache Flink or Apache Beam) this is usually automatically managed by these frameworks. In other systems may choose something like a threadpool to do that.\nNote that if you need multiple instances of the UserAgentAnalyzer then you MUST create a new Builder instance for each of those (or serialize an instance and deserialize it multiple times).\nUserAgentAnalyzer uaa = UserAgentAnalyzer .newBuilder() .hideMatcherLoadStats() .withCache(10000) .build(); Then for each useragent (or set of request headers) you call the parse method to give you the desired result:\nUserAgent agent = uaa.parse(\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11\"); for (String fieldName: agent.getAvailableFieldNamesSorted()) { System.out.println(fieldName + \" = \" + agent.getValue(fieldName)); } Note that not all fields are available after every parse. So be prepared to receive a null, Unknown or another field specific default.\nCustom caching implementation Since version 6.7 you can specify a custom implementation for the cache by providing an instance of the factory interface CacheInstantiator.\nDo note that Yauaa assumes the caching implementation to be threadsafe. If you use a non-threadsafe implementation in a multithreaded context it will break.\nThe default caching implementation uses Caffeine (since version 6.8).\nreturn Caffeine.newBuilder().maximumSize(cacheSize).\u003cString, ImmutableUserAgent\u003ebuild().asMap(); A custom implementation can be specified via the Builder using the withCacheInstantiator(...) method:\nUserAgentAnalyzer uaa = UserAgentAnalyzer .newBuilder() .withCacheInstantiator( new CacheInstantiator() { @Override public Map\u003cString, ImmutableUserAgent\u003e instantiateCache(int cacheSize) { return new MyMuchBetterCacheImplementation(cacheSize); } } ) .withClientHintCacheInstantiator( (ClientHintsCacheInstantiator\u003c?\u003e) size -\u003e Collections.synchronizedMap(new LRUMap\u003c\u003e(size))) .withCache(10000) .build(); Running on Java 8 Normal use Yauaa 7.x still allows running on Java 8, yet the default caching library needs Java 11.\nSince version 7.19.0 the selection of the caching implementation is automatically based upon the Java version used to run it. Running in Java 8 - Java 10 the LRUMap (caching implementation that is part of the Apache commons-collections library) is used, Java 11 and newer Caffeine is used.\nIf needed (and also for backwards compatibility and testing) you can still force it to use the LRUMap regardless of the Java version by doing something like this:\nUserAgentAnalyzer uaa = UserAgentAnalyzer .newBuilder() .useJava8CompatibleCaching() .withCache(10000) .build(); Really ONLY Java 8 If you have a very strict requirement that no classes are in the project that are above JDK 8 then you should do 2 things:\nExclude the caffeine dependency Maven pom.xml snippet\n\u003cdependencies\u003e \u003cdependency\u003e \u003cgroupId\u003enl.basjes.parse.useragent\u003c/groupId\u003e \u003cartifactId\u003eyauaa\u003c/artifactId\u003e \u003cversion\u003e7.28.1\u003c/version\u003e \u003cexclusions\u003e \u003cexclusion\u003e \u003cgroupId\u003ecom.github.ben-manes.caffeine\u003c/groupId\u003e \u003cartifactId\u003ecaffeine\u003c/artifactId\u003e \u003c/exclusion\u003e \u003c/exclusions\u003e \u003c/dependency\u003e \u003c/dependencies\u003e Gradle snippet\nimplementation('nl.basjes.parse.useragent:yauaa:7.28.1') { exclude group: 'com.github.ben-manes.caffeine', module: 'caffeine' } Make sure the used caching library is always the Java 8 compatible one. Either by only running on Java 8 Or by forcing the caching to always use the Java 8 with something like this: UserAgentAnalyzer uaa = UserAgentAnalyzer .newBuilder() .useJava8CompatibleCaching() .withCache(10000) .build(); Logging dependencies The Yauaa engine uses Log4j2 API as the logging framework.\nTo minimize the complexity of the dependency handling I have chosen to simply not include ANY logging framework and expect the consuming system to provide what ever fits best. Even the required log4j-api 2.x dependency is configured as provided to avoid any needless version conflicts.\nTo use Yauaa you must provide the desired version of log4j-api and either an implementation or a bridge for Apache Log4j2 to route the logging to where you want it.\nSo it all depends on your exact context (i.e. which logging framework are you going to use) what the best solution is for you to make all of this logging work as intended.\nIn case you are using Apache Log4j2 you should have these dependencies in addition to Yauaa in your project\n\u003c!-- The default logging implementation for Yauaa --\u003e \u003cdependency\u003e \u003cgroupId\u003eorg.apache.logging.log4j\u003c/groupId\u003e \u003cartifactId\u003elog4j-core\u003c/artifactId\u003e \u003cversion\u003e${log4j2.version}\u003c/version\u003e \u003c/dependency\u003e Regarding the Log4J2 issues The Yauaa analyzer uses the Log4J2 API to do the logging.\nTL;DR:\nThe core of Yauaa is safe as it does not include any logging dependencies and expects the application to provide everything. In normal operations user input is not logged. The Snowflake UDF is affected by these problems (due to shading the dependencies in). NO batteries included By design the Yauaa library expects the application in which it is used to provide the actual logging dependencies and configuration. If you do not provide the needed logging classes it will simply fail at startup.\nSo by design the Yauaa library expects all of these frameworks to be provided (and configured) and does not include any of them or any configuration for them.\nThis is true for most of the released artifacts (including the base library) except for the Snowflake UDF which does include almost all dependencies. So the Snowflake UDF IS affected by this issue and all users are recommended to update.\nMinimal logging Note that Yauaa does not log any user input and/or analysis results from user input during normal operation. Only during development and during unit tests the Useragents are logged.\nThis is because it was designed to run in very large scale batch and streaming situations (very large as in “Let’s analyze these 10^10 records”).\nBring your own batteries To assist in running Yauaa without the logj4-core jar an example was created that only uses SLF4J 1.x and and example that only uses SLF4J 2.x.\nSerialization If your application needs to serialize the instance of the UserAgentAnalyzer then both the standard Java serialization and Kryo are supported. Note that with Kryo 5.x you need to register all classes and configure Kryo correctly.\nTo facilitate doing this correctly the static method configureKryo was created. So in general your code should look something like this:\nKryo kryo = new Kryo(); UserAgentAnalyzer.configureKryo(kryo); Note that both the serializing and the deserializing instance of Kryo must be configured in the same way.\nAvoid using it as a static member If you make the UserAgentAnalyzer a static member of a class then cleaning it up after use may be a problem. One case where this happens is in the context of something like Tomcat where a webapp is loaded and then unloaded. If the analyzer is a static member of your servlet then this unloading may retain a lot of the memory used for the internal data structures.\nCache size setting I recommend you leave the cache to a size that is roughly the unique number of useragents your site finds in a limited timespan. Something like 15/30/60 minutes usually gives you a fine cache size. On a very busy website I see ~50K-60K distinct useragents per day and ~10K per hour. So in my opinion a cache size of 5K-10K elements is a good choice.\nReducing the memory footprint Limiting to only certain fields In some scenarios you only want a specific field and all others are unwanted. This can be achieved by creating the analyzer in Java like this:\nUserAgentAnalyzer uaa = UserAgentAnalyzer .newBuilder() .withField(\"DeviceClass\") .withField(\"AgentNameVersionMajor\") .build(); One important effect is that this speeds up the system because it will kick any rules that do not help in getting the desired fields. The above example showed an approximate 40% speed increase (i.e. times dropped from ~1ms to ~0.6ms).\nDo note that some fields need other fields as input (i.e. intermediate result). For example the DeviceBrand also needs the AgentInformationEmail and AgentInformationUrl because in some cases the actual brand is derived from for example the domainname that usually is present in those. So if you only ask for the DomainBrand you will get those fields also.\nIn the nl.basjes.parse.useragent.UserAgent many (not all!!) of the provided variables are provided as a constant String. You can choose to use these and avoid subtle typos in the requested attribute names.\nUserAgentAnalyzer uaa = UserAgentAnalyzer .newBuilder() .withField(DEVICE_CLASS) .withField(AGENT_NAME_VERSION_MAJOR) .build(); Sharing the config between instances (new in 7.24.0) In some situations you may want to have multiple instances to handle the load within in a single JVM. In those cases you’ll also want the configuration of all instances to be identical.\nIf you are in exactly that scenario you can create a duplicate instance with the exact same configuration and save a few MiB of memory. The currently estimated savings is at about 20-30MiB for each extra instance (depending on the configuration).\nUserAgentAnalyzer extraUaa = uaa.cloneWithSharedAnalyzerConfig(false, true); Building your project with -Xlint:all If you are trying to get rid of all possible problems in your application and set the compiler flag -Xlint:all you will see warnings relating to the Kryo serialization system.\n[WARNING] COMPILATION WARNING : [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------- [WARNING] Cannot find annotation method 'value()' in type 'com.esotericsoftware.kryo.DefaultSerializer': class file for com.esotericsoftware.kryo.DefaultSerializer not found [WARNING] Cannot find annotation method 'value()' in type 'com.esotericsoftware.kryo.DefaultSerializer' [INFO] 2 warnings The Yauaa analyzer has been prepared in such a way that it can be serialized using both the standard Java serialization and the Kryo serialization library. The Kryo library has been configured as a “provided” dependency because many do not need it, and (to avoid version conflicts) those who do need it have this dependency already.\nIf your project does not use Kryo and you have this warning then there are several ways to work around this:\nDisable the Xlint check that triggers this warning. Apparently this is the “classfile” so try to use -Xlint:all,-classfile instead.

Because the internal analyzer code is not reentrant the main method has been synchronized on the instance. So from the perspective of you the application developer this library is thread safe.\nIf you are in a multi threaded situation you should create a separate instance per thread or accept the speed limitation of the shared synchronized instance.\nNote that you should really instantiate it only once per thread (and use a ThreadPool or something similar) because starting a new instance takes several seconds.\nEclipse users Be aware of there is a bug in Eclipse which will show you errors in perfectly valid Java code: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=527475 The errors you see are related to the inheritance model used by the Builders in this project and the fact that Eclipse does not interpret it correctly.\nScala usage When using this library from a Scala application the way the Builders have been constructed turns out to be very unfriendly to use.\nStarting with Yauaa version 5.14 the rewritten builders (contributed by Robert Stoll) will become available which will make it a lot easier for Scala users to use:\nval uaa = UserAgentAnalyzer.newBuilder .withCache(10000) .hideMatcherLoadStats .withField(\"DeviceClass\") .build Snapshots Occasionally I publish a snapshot version.

These have been augmented with observations how developers apparently do things. There are really no (ok, very limited) lookup tables that define if a certain device name is a Phone or a Tablet. This makes this system very maintainable because there is no need to have a list of all possible devices.\nAs a consequence if a useragent does not follow these patterns the analysis will yield the ‘wrong’ answer. Take for example these two (both were found exactly as shown here in the logs of a live website):\nMozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 5.1; SAMSUNG-T805s Build/KOT49H) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/45.0.2454.94 Mobile Safari/537.36 Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 4.4.2; SAMSUNG-T805S Build/KOT49H) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/50.0.2661.89 Safari/537.36 The difference between “Mobile Safari” and “Safari” has been defined for Google Chrome as the difference between “Phone” and “Tablet” (see the Chrome documentation on this).\nAnd as you can see in this example: we sometimes get it wrong (The Samsung T805s is in reality a Tablet). The impact in this case is however very limited: Of the 445 visitors I found using this device only 2 were classified wrong all others were correct.\nUnexpected differences Some cases that seem very similar to the previous example are in a way correct.\nTake for example the Samsung Galaxy S8 (SM-G950F) which is a Phone.\nIn normal use the Useragent looks like this:\nMozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 9; SM-G950F) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/105.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36 when this device is connected to a computer screen then “Samsung Dex” (Dex = Desktop Experience) takes over and the screen layout and usage of the phone changes dramatically.\nMozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 9; SM-G950F) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/105.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 This time the change (from Mobile Safari to just Safari) indicates the device is to be treated as a Tablet because the screen size and ways of interacting have changed.\nSome are simply incorrect When the Samsung Browser is installed on a non-Samsung device (in this example a Google Nexus 6) you get this:\nMozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0; SAMSUNG Nexus 6 Build/NBD92G) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) SamsungBrowser/5.4 Chrome/51.0.2704.106 Mobile Safari/537.36 As you can see this browser assumes it is only installed on Samsung devices so they ‘force’ the word Samsung in there. In this case you will see this being reported as a “Samsung Nexus 6”, which is obviously wrong.\nNote that this specific case with the SamsungBrowser has now been fixed with a set of additional rules so this one is now correctly reported as a Google Nexus 6.\nDevice Name and Device Brand The detection of the brand and name of the device are the most brittle and unreliable part of the output.\nThere are a few reasons for this:\nThere are a LOT of different devices from a LOT of vendors. To give you an impression; In november 2018 I did a count on the index page of DeviceAtlas and found over 4100 brands and a total of over 55000 different devices. In most cases the useragent string ONLY include the model of the device and NOT the brand. So you need to be able to determine JUST from the model what brand it was. This system tries to limit the number of lookup tables and rely on patterns as much as possible. As a consequence I really do not want to have a complete list of all devices in here. So what are the patterns in the mapping from model to brand? I did an analysis on some of these brands and found that Acer, Lenovo, LG and QMobile all have a device called ‘A200’. So if the useragent only contains ‘A200’ there is no way to determine what device it really was. So as a consequence I have chosen to limit this detection to\nBrands that are included as the first word in the appropriate field. Special cases (like robots) The “most used brands” as good as possible. WARNING: The detection of DeviceBrand will therefore never be complete and accurate.",

    "content": "Detecting new useragent patterns When you find a useragent for which one or more of the fields are wrong there is the need to change the patterns and rules that are used by this system for classifying these attributes. In order to write rules this first described how the system works and what tools have been created to make writing new rules easier.\nBase problem: They all lie When looking at useragents it is clear that almost all of them include the name of predecessors/competitors with which they are supposed to be compatible with.\nSo in general there is a ranking in the patterns; some are more true than others.\nSolution overview The way this system solves all of this is by employing several steps:\nThe user agent string is parsed into a tree using Antlr4. This tree is matched against a set of “Matchers” A matcher is a set of patterns that must be present in the tree a set of field/value combinations with a ‘weight’ the value can be either a fixed value or a part of the tree. For all matchers where ALL required patterns were present the field/value/weight results are all combined. For fields where multiple values were present the value with the highest weight ‘wins’ All matchers are with tests placed in yaml files in the UserAgents directory. Because of the system with the weights the order of the matchers is not checked or guaranteed in any way. So if the two matchers may set the same field to a different value then better make sure they have different weights.\nThe anatomy of a matcher A matcher consists of 3 parts require extract options\nThe “require” part holds the patterns that must all result in a non-null value. The IsNull operator is intended to check that a specific value actually IS null. The “extract” part is to send either a fixed string or an extracted pattern into a field with a certain numerical confidence.\nThere are a few possible option flags:\ninit This means the init output for this matcher must be shown. This is the same effect when running it without any extract values verbose This means that a LOT of debug output will be shown in the output. only This means that ONLY this test must be run. No others.\nOnly IFF all require AND all extract patterns yielded a non-null value then will all of the extracted values be added to the end result. In general a field will receive a value from multiple matchers; the value with the highest confidence value will be in the output.\nThe overall structure is this:\nconfig: - lookup: name: 'lookupname' map: \"From1\" : \"To1\" \"From2\" : \"To2\" \"From3\" : \"To3\" - set: name: 'setname' merge: - 'nameOtherSet' - 'nameOtherLookup' values: - 'foo' - 'bar' - matcher: options: - 'verbose' variable: - 'VariableName : Extract pattern' - 'VariableName : Extract pattern' require: - 'Require pattern' - 'Require pattern' extract: - 'FieldName : Confidence : Extract pattern' - 'FieldName : Confidence : Extract pattern' - test: options: - 'verbose' - 'init' input: user_agent_string: 'Useragent' expected: FieldName1 : 'ExpectedValue1' FieldName2 : 'ExpectedValue2' FieldName3 : 'ExpectedValue3' A require pattern must simply yield a non-null value. The IsNull operator only makes sense in the context of a require as with this you can check that a pattern may not exist.\nFor example to do checks like “The last product in the list must be named foo” you can write this\n- matcher: require: - 'IsNull[agent.product.name=\"foo\"^\u003e]' An extract pattern is either a fixed string “foo” or a path expression as explained later in this document.\nWhere the rules are located Under the main resources there is a folder called UserAgents . In the folder a collection of yaml files are located. Each of those files contains matchers, lookups, tests or any combination of them in any order. This means that in many cases you’ll find a relevant test case close to the rules.\nUseragent parse tree model According to RFC-2616 a useragent consists of set of products. Each with an (optional) version and an (optional) comment block.\nhttps://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.8 https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.43\nAfter much analysis the model that this parser uses it as follows:\nThe whole string (the ‘agent’) is mostly cut into ‘product’ and ’text’ parts. Each child node in the tree is numbered (1,2,3,…) within the context of the parent. A product has zero or more ‘version’ fields and zero or more ‘comments’ fields. Each comments’ has one or more ’entry’: In a comment block like this ‘foo/1.0 (one; two three; four)’ we will have 3 entries (they are ; separated).\nFrom there the system recurses down within limitations.\nFlattened form of the tree If we take this useragent as an example the tree is flattened into a set of ‘breadcrumb’ type paths.\nI put some spaces in various places so you can see what happens with those (in most places they are trimmed):\nfoo/1.0 ( one ; two three; four ) bar/2.0 (five;six seven) will result in these paths (with their textual value)\nagent=\"foo/1.0 ( one ; two three; four ) bar/2.0 (five;six seven)\" agent.(1)product=\"foo/1.0 ( one ; two three; four )\" agent.(1)product[1-1]=\"foo\" agent.(1)product[1-2]=\"foo/1\" agent.(1)product[2-2]=\"1\" agent.(1)product[1-3]=\"foo/1.0\" agent.(1)product[3-3]=\"0\" agent.(1)product.(1)name=\"foo\" agent.(1)product.(1)name[1-1]=\"foo\" agent.(1)product.(1)version=\"1.0\" agent.(1)product.(1)version[1-1]=\"1\" agent.(1)product.(1)version[1-2]=\"1.0\" agent.(1)product.(1)version[2-2]=\"0\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments=\"( one ; two three; four )\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(1)entry=\"one\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(1)entry[1-1]=\"one\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(1)entry.(1)text=\"one\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(1)entry.(1)text[1-1]=\"one\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(2)entry=\"two three\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(2)entry[1-1]=\"two\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(2)entry[1-2]=\"two three\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(2)entry[2-2]=\"three\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(2)entry.(1)text=\"two three\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(2)entry.(1)text[1-1]=\"two\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(2)entry.(1)text[1-2]=\"two three\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(2)entry.(1)text[2-2]=\"three\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(3)entry=\"four\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(3)entry[1-1]=\"four\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(3)entry.(1)text=\"four\" agent.(1)product.(1)comments.(3)entry.(1)text[1-1]=\"four\" agent.(2)product=\"bar/2.0 (five;six seven)\" agent.(2)product[1-1]=\"bar\" agent.(2)product[1-2]=\"bar/2\" agent.(2)product[2-2]=\"2\" agent.(2)product[1-3]=\"bar/2.0\" agent.(2)product[3-3]=\"0\" agent.(2)product.(1)name=\"bar\" agent.(2)product.(1)name[1-1]=\"bar\" agent.(2)product.(1)version=\"2.0\" agent.(2)product.(1)version[1-1]=\"2\" agent.(2)product.(1)version[1-2]=\"2.0\" agent.(2)product.(1)version[2-2]=\"0\" agent.(2)product.(1)comments=\"(five;six seven)\" agent.(2)product.(1)comments.(1)entry=\"five\" agent.(2)product.(1)comments.(1)entry[1-1]=\"five\" agent.(2)product.(1)comments.(1)entry.(1)text=\"five\" agent.(2)product.(1)comments.(1)entry.(1)text[1-1]=\"five\" agent.(2)product.(1)comments.(2)entry=\"six seven\" agent.(2)product.(1)comments.(2)entry[1-1]=\"six\" agent.(2)product.(1)comments.(2)entry[1-2]=\"six seven\" agent.(2)product.(1)comments.(2)entry[2-2]=\"seven\" agent.(2)product.(1)comments.(2)entry.(1)text=\"six seven\" agent.(2)product.(1)comments.(2)entry.(1)text[1-1]=\"six\" agent.(2)product.(1)comments.(2)entry.(1)text[1-2]=\"six seven\" agent.(2)product.(1)comments.(2)entry.(1)text[2-2]=\"seven\" As you can see there are a few special operators that allow comparing and extracting specific words.\nWalking around the tree In many cases we want to get the version of the product with a specific name. This means we should look to the product with that name and from there go ‘up’ to the product and from there select the ‘version’.\nFor this purpose a special language has been created that allows walking through a tree from the point where a match was found and do additional compare and string manipulation actions to obtain the value we are looking for.\nThis language also supports lookups (hashmaps) that do a case INsensitive lookup.\nNote that for finding a matching pattern the system will recurse through the parse tree from left to right. The FIRST matching pattern is used for the end result.\nFor demonstrating the operators I’m using this user agent to explain the effects:\nfoo faa/1.0 2.3 (one; two three four) bar baz/2.0 3.0 (five; six seven) Available operators:\nWalking around the tree\nOperation Symbol Example Result value (if applicable) Up to parent ^ agent.(1)product.name^ agent.(1)product Next Sibling \u003e agent.(1)product\u003e agent.(2)product Previous Sibling \u003c agent.(2)product\u003c agent.(1)product Down to child .name agent.(1)product.version Down to specific child .(2)version agent.(1)product.(2)version Down to specific child range .(2-3)version agent.(1)product.(2-3)version Down to specific child range .(2-)version agent.(1)product.(2-)version Down to specific child range .(-5)version agent.(1)product.(-5)version Comparing values in the tree\nOperation Symbol Example Result value (if applicable) Explain Equals = agent.(1)product.version=“2.3” agent.(1)product.(2)version The second version is “2.3” Not equals != agent.(1)product.version!=“1.0” agent.(1)product.(2)version The second version is the first one when backtracking that is not “1.0” Contains ~ agent.product.name~“ar” agent.(2)product.(1)name=“bar baz” The first product name when backtracking that contains “ar” Starts with { agent.product.name{“b” agent.(2)product.(1)name=“bar baz” The first product name when backtracking that starts with “b” Ends with } agent.product.name}“z” agent.(2)product.(1)name=“bar baz” The first product name when backtracking that ends with “z” (Key)set contains ? agent.product.name?mySetOfValues agent.(3)product.(1)name The name of the third product was present in the defined set of values.

If a child sibling or check fails the backtracking continues until the entire parse tree has been examined.\nI created a test that shows all of the debug output of this example: unit test and yaml file\nThis can also be run from the commandline using:\nmvn -Dtest=DocumentationExample -DfailIfNoTests=false test Creating a new rule Assume we got this useragent\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; Foo/3.1; Bar) and let’s just assume we want to set a field called MinorFooVersion if the minor version of Foo is 1\nTo start we put the agent as a new test in one of the yaml files. If we choose to create a new file make sure is starts with “config:”\n- test: input: user_agent_string: 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Foo/3.1; Bar)' Now we run the unit test “TestPredefinedBrowsers”. On a normal computer this will take only about 1-5 seconds.\nThe output contains all the field values for this useragent in the exact form of a unit test.\nSo once you are happy with the result you can simply copy and past this into the yaml file.\nIn this case is looks something like this:\n- test: # options: # - 'verbose' # - 'init' # - 'only' input: user_agent_string: 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Foo/3.1; Bar)' expected: DeviceClass : 'Unknown' DeviceName : 'Unknown' OperatingSystemClass : 'Unknown' OperatingSystemName : 'Unknown' OperatingSystemVersion : '??'

Then simply copy the end ’test’ into the yaml file and save.\nIf you are detecting a new field or a new value for an existing field then be aware that this may also apply to tests that are already present in the system. For all tests to pass these must be updated also.\nYou can choose to use this in a more “Test Driven Development” model also. Simply run the unit test, copy the ‘raw testcase’ into the yaml file and edit the values to what they should be and work from there.\nIf you run it this way your will get a ‘failed test’ which yields a bit of extra output. For the sake of demo if I simply put this testcase in the yaml file\n- test: input: user_agent_string: 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Foo/3.1; Bar)' expected: AgentClass : 'Browser' AgentName : 'Foo' AgentVersion : '3.1' AgentVersionMajor : '3' AgentNameVersion : 'Foo 3.1' AgentNameVersionMajor : 'Foo 3' MinorFooVersion : '1' This would also show as test output:\n[INFO ] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 89: +--------+------------------------------+-------------+---------+------------+------------+ [INFO ] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 89: | Result | Field | Actual | Default | Confidence | Expected | [INFO ] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 89: +--------+------------------------------+-------------+---------+------------+------------+ [ERROR] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 109: | -FAIL- | LayoutEngineClass | Browser | | 3 | \u003c\u003cabsent\u003e\u003e | [ERROR] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 109: | -FAIL- | LayoutEngineName | Mozilla | | 3 | \u003c\u003cabsent\u003e\u003e | [ERROR] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 109: | -FAIL- | LayoutEngineVersion | 5.0 | | 3 | \u003c\u003cabsent\u003e\u003e | [ERROR] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 109: | -FAIL- | LayoutEngineVersionMajor | 5 | | 3 | \u003c\u003cabsent\u003e\u003e | [ERROR] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 109: | -FAIL- | LayoutEngineNameVersion | Mozilla 5.0 | | 3 | \u003c\u003cabsent\u003e\u003e | [ERROR] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 109: | -FAIL- | LayoutEngineNameVersionMajor | Mozilla 5 | | 3 | \u003c\u003cabsent\u003e\u003e | [INFO ] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 89: | | AgentClass | Browser | | 10 | | [INFO ] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 89: | | AgentName | Foo | | 10 | | [INFO ] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 89: | | AgentVersion | 3.1 | | 10 | | [INFO ] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 89: | | AgentVersionMajor | 3 | | 10 | | [INFO ] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 89: | | AgentNameVersion | Foo 3.1 | | 10 | | [INFO ] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 89: | | AgentNameVersionMajor | Foo 3 | | 10 | | [ERROR] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 109: | -FAIL- | AgentLanguage | Bavarian | | 500006 | \u003c\u003cabsent\u003e\u003e | [ERROR] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 109: | -FAIL- | AgentLanguageCode | bar | | 500006 | \u003c\u003cabsent\u003e\u003e | [ERROR] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 109: | -FAIL- | MinorFooVersion | ?? | Default | -1 | 1 | [INFO ] AbstractUserAgentAnalyzerTester : 89: +--------+------------------------------+-------------+---------+------------+------------+ As you can see the system will fail on missing fields, unexpected fields and wrong values.\nIf you create rules that in one of the test cases produce for the same field different values with the same confidence then the test will fail with messages like this:\n- *********************************************************** - *** REALLY IMPORTANT ERRORS IN THE RULESET *** - *** YOU MUST CHANGE THE CONFIDENCE LEVELS OF YOUR RULES *** - *********************************************************** - Found different value for \"OperatingSystemName\" with SAME confidence 10: \"RIM OS\" and \"BlackBerry\" - Found different value for \"OperatingSystemName\" with SAME confidence 10: \"RIM OS\" and \"BlackBerry\" - Found different value for \"OperatingSystemName\" with SAME confidence 10: \"RIM OS\" and \"BlackBerry\" - Found different value for \"OperatingSystemVersion\" with SAME confidence 10: \"RIM OS\" and \"??\" - Found different value for \"OperatingSystemVersion\" with SAME confidence 10: \"RIM OS\" and \"??\" - Found different value for \"OperatingSystemVersion\" with SAME confidence 10: \"RIM OS\" and \"??\" Note that these do not need to be the ‘winning’ value. The existence of the ambiguity is enough to fail.\nThe Known, the Unknown and the faker In most cases an extract will put a value (Mozilla) into a field with a confidence.\nIn addition to this normal case there are two additional cases that need to be covered:\nWe use the special value \u003c\u003c\u003cnull\u003e\u003e\u003e if we do not know the value (i.e. the end result should say Unknown or ??) and we do want the post processing to try and fill the field with an alternative.\nThis is then labeled as Default. Example: We do not know the DeviceBrand and as a fall back the hostname in the URL (if any) is used. We simply use something like Unknown or ?? if we do not know the value (i.e. the end result should say Unknown or ??) and we are sure we do NOT want any post processing to try and find something better.\nThis is then labeled as not Default. Example: We do not know the DeviceBrand because it matched the pattern of a GoogleBot immitator and we do not want to see Google as the brand. Wiping values In some cases a previously defined value needs to be erased with a higher confidence. To achieve this simply set the value to \u003c\u003c\u003cnull\u003e\u003e\u003e\nIn addition there is a way to set all variables to a certain value by setting the special value __Set_ALL_Fields__\nBecause the ordering is defined by the confidence numbers you must make sure the confidence of the new values are at least 1 higher than the confidence of the __Set_ALL_Fields__.\nBoth of these can be combined into\nextract: - '__Set_ALL_Fields__ : 99:\"\u003c\u003c\u003cnull\u003e\u003e\u003e\"' Note that ALL fields with a confidence below 99 will be wiped. So the field values you set in this matcher must all be 1 higher than this or it will wipe itself too.\nPerformance considerations Note that in order to optimize the performance the paths that lead directly to a point in the tree are placed in a hashmap for very fast lookup.\nOnly if all ‘direct paths’ in a matcher are found only then the walking of those rules is attempted.\nSo one of the rules looks like this\n- matcher: require: - 'agent.product.(1)name=\"Chrome\"' - 'LookUp[ChromeLayoutEngineName;agent.product.(1)name=\"Chrome\"^.version[1]]' - 'agent.product.(1)name=\"AppleWebKit\"^.version[1]=\"537\"' - 'agent.product.(1)version[1]=\"537\"' # This is a matching speedup trick extract: - 'LayoutEngineClass : 1000:\"Browser\"' - 'LayoutEngineName : 1000:\"AppleWebKit\"' - 'LayoutEngineVersion : 1000:agent.product.(1)name=\"AppleWebKit\"^.version' The agent.product.(1)version[1]=“537” is found immediately while walking through the parsed tree. So if this one is not present then the other check “Is the version of AppleWebKit equals to 537” and the lookup are not even attempted. These kinds of tricks will speedup parsing.\nVariables There is the option of predefining a value which is then usable by all rules in a matcher.\nA variable is simply a named point in the tree that is found only once and the reused as-is by the other rules within the same matcher. A variable is also always in essence a ‘require’, it must be present for the matcher as a whole to continue. You can only reference a variable by name in a later variable. This is because they are evaluated in the order in which they appear in the definition in the file. The variable name follows a similar pattern as variable names in languages like Java: [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]+ When referencing a variable (by means of @name) in an expression you must see it as a point in the tree that happens to have a name.\nThis looks like this:\n- matcher: variable: - 'Chrome : agent.product.(1)name=\"Chrome\"' - 'AppleWebKitVersion : agent.product.(1)name=\"AppleWebKit\"^.version' require: - 'LookUp[ChromeLayoutEngineName;@Chrome^.version[1]]' - '@AppleWebKitVersion[1]=\"537\"' - 'agent.product.(1)version[1]=\"537\"' # This is a matching speedup trick extract: - 'LayoutEngineClass : 1000:\"Browser\"' - 'LayoutEngineName : 1000:\"AppleWebKit\"' - 'LayoutEngineVersion : 1000:@AppleWebKitVersion' Note that the backtracking stops when the variable finds its first match. So when defined like this:\nextract: - 'Something: 1: agent.product.(1)name=\"AppleWebKit\"^.version' it may find after backtracking that the 5th product matches\nagent.(5)product.(1)version Yet when defined like this\nvariable: - 'productname: agent.product.(1)name' extract: - 'Something: 1: @productname=\"AppleWebKit\"^.version' it will stay at the first product and never find the 5th product at all.",

As a direct consequence the analysis results will become less usefull over time as browsers will start taking away more and more information.\nhttps://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5704553745874944 The (Q1 2022) DRAFT proposal of the User-Agent Client Hints is intended to contain the information needed in a cleaner way.\nhttps://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/ https://github.com/WICG/ua-client-hints At this point in time (Q1 2022):\nThis is not a standard yet Not all browsers support this Chromium based browsers support this. Firefox 97 does not. Compatibility Also (as I have written a long time ago in this article) the UserAgents set values to show to websites what they are compatible with.\nIn 2021 several browsers stopped updating the version number of the underlying operating system because of compatibility problems with poorly written websites.\nAlso several browsers are reaching version 100 which makes the version 3 digits; which leads to parsing problems if a website expects a 2 digit version.\nThis has led to some testing flags for website builders like chrome://flags/#force-major-version-to-100\nForce major version to 100 in User-Agent\nForce the Chrome major version in the User-Agent string to 100, which allows testing the 3-digit major version number before the actual M100 release. This flag is only available from M96-M99. – Mac, Windows, Linux, Chrome OS, Android, Fuchsia\nand also chrome://flags/#force-minor-version-to-100\nForce the minor version to 100 in the User-Agent string\nForce the Chrome minor version in the User-Agent string to 100, which allows testing a 3-digit minor version number. Currently, the minor version is always reported as 0, but due to potential breakage with the upcoming major version 100, this flag allows us to test whether setting the major version in the minor version part of the User-Agent string would be an acceptable alternative. If force-major-version-to-100 is set, then this flag has no effect. See crbug.com/1278459 for details. – Mac, Windows, Linux, Chrome OS, Android, Fuchsia\nHold on: They are testing if they can set the major version in the minor version position … to work around broken websites?\nIn Chrome/Edge 99 has actually implemented this flag:\nchrome://flags/#force-major-version-to-minor\nPut major version in minor version position in User-Agent\nLock the Microsoft Edge major version in the User-Agent string to 99, and force the major version number to the minor version position. This flag is a backup plan for unexpected site-compatibility breakage with a three digit major version. – Mac, Windows, Linux, Chrome OS, Android, Fuchsia\nSo you get the effect:\nChrome/99.0.1150.25 = Chrome 99 Chrome/99.123.1150.25 = Chrome 123 Don’t worry: Yauaa actually detects and handles this and reports the correct version.\nThere is no MacOS 11 Both Chromium (=Chrome, Edge, …) and Firefox have frozen the version of MacOS X to 10.15(.7) and as a consequence MacOS 11 … simply does not appear in any of their UserAgents. As a consequence these specific versions are reported as unknown version (??).\nBack ground information:\nAlways 10_15_7 since Chrome 90. Always 10.15 since Firefox 87. There is no Windows 11 in Chromium/Chrome/Edge/… Microsoft has documented here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/web-platform/how-to-detect-win11\nThere are two approaches for sites to access user agent information:\nUser-Agent strings (legacy). User-Agent Client Hints (recommended). Websites can differentiate between users on Windows 11 and Windows 10 by using User-Agent Client Hints (UA-CH).`\nand\nUser-Agent strings won’t be updated to differentiate between Windows 11 and Windows 10. We don’t recommend using User-Agent strings to retrieve user agent data. Browsers that don’t support User-Agent Client Hints won’t be able to differentiate between Windows 11 and Windows 10.\nAnd thus the Chrome UserAgent on Windows 11 looks like this:\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/99.0.4844.51 Safari/537.36\nWhich clealy says: Windows 10.0\nThere is no Windows 11 in Firefox Firefox has an explicit issue called Cap the Windows version in the User-Agent to 10.0..\nTheir code comment clearly describes why\nCap the reported Windows version to 10.0. This way, Microsoft doesn’t get to change Web compat-sensitive values without our veto. The compat-sensitivity keeps going up as 10.0 stays as the current value for longer and longer. If the system-reported version ever changes, we’ll be able to take our time to evaluate the Web compat impact instead of having to scamble to react like happened with macOS changing from 10.x to 11.x.",

As a consequence the downstream users (like the udfs in this project) still include the entire set of dependencies (not used by the code) in addition to the shaded versions (used by the code).\nThis is a known problem in the Maven shade plugin: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSHADE-36\nFor which I’ve put up a pull request: https://github.com/apache/maven-shade-plugin/pull/25\nSolution 2: Inject the dependency-reduced-pom.xml into the final jar This way building an external project no longer includes things like Antlr a second time.\nWith the maven-shade-plugin version 3.3.0 (2022-03-24) this is now a built-in feature:\n\u003cuseDependencyReducedPomInJar\u003etrue\u003c/useDependencyReducedPomInJar\u003e Problem 3: The other modules look at the original pom.xml So after solution 2 it is all fine for external projects using the created jar file because they look at the pom.xml in that jar file.\nThe remaining problem is that any other module in this (multi module) project will look at the original pom.xml instead of the cleaned one in the jar file.\nAs a consequence the Hive UDF jar file contains\n$ unzip -l udfs/hive/target/yauaa-hive-5.12-SNAPSHOT-udf.jar | fgrep org/springframework/core/io/ResourceLoader.class 494 2019-08-23 12:26 nl/basjes/shaded/org/springframework/core/io/ResourceLoader.class 487 2019-02-13 05:32 org/springframework/core/io/ResourceLoader.class I filed a bug report/ missing feature for this in the Maven shade plugin: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSHADE-326\nFor which I’ve put up a pull request: https://github.com/apache/maven-shade-plugin/pull/26\nSolution 3: Manually exclude them So we exclude these 4 shaded dependencies in all modules in this project so they are no longer included double in the final jars.\nProblem 4: No such classfile … Which gives rise to a new problem: When building/developing these modules the code will complain about missing dependencies. The dependencies have been shaded, relocated and excluded … which means that any code looking for the ‘original’ class name will find it to be missing.\nSolution 4: Include as ‘provided’ The final step I had to take was to include these 4 dependencies again as ‘provided’ in all modules in this project.\nAdditional notes Immediately setting these dependencies to ‘provided’ causes them not to be included by the shade plugin.

The Chromium team have clearly documented that they are removing information from the User-Agent header and replace parts with fixed values that are almost meaningless.\nSee: https://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction/\nFrozen Windows versions Take for example this User-Agent:\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Most people expect to get\nOperatingSystemNameVersion : 'Windows 10.0' AgentNameVersion : 'Chrome 100.0.0.0' but instead they get\nOperatingSystemNameVersion : 'Windows NT ??' AgentNameVersion : 'Chrome 100' and then report that as a bug.\nThis is not a bug.\nThis example was recorded on a Windows 7 system and there is nothing in the User-Agent to extract this anymore.\nFrozen Android version A similar effect is with\nMozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/113.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36 Most people expect to get\nOperatingSystemNameVersion : 'Android 10' but instead they get\nOperatingSystemNameVersion : 'Android ??' Again: This is not a bug.\nThis example was recorded on an Android 11 system and there is nothing in the User-Agent to extract this anymore.\nYour best workaround At this point in time (mid 2022) the best way around much of these manipulations and lies is by asking for and recording the User-Agent Client Hints on your website.\nIf you ask for these User-Agent Client Hints you can get something like these extra request headers in addition to the User-Agent from the browser.\nHeader Value Sec-Ch-Ua \" Not A;Brand\";v=“99”, “Chromium”;v=“100”, “Google Chrome”;v=“100” Sec-Ch-Ua-Arch “x86” Sec-Ch-Ua-Full-Version-List \" Not A;Brand\";v=“99.0.0.0”, “Chromium”;v=“100.0.4896.75”, “Google Chrome”;v=“100.0.4896.75” Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile ?0 Sec-Ch-Ua-Model \"\" Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform “Windows” Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform-Version “0.1.0” Sec-Ch-Ua-Wow64 ?0 With all of this extra information Yauaa can now correctly report the above mentioned Windows 7 example as:\nOperatingSystemNameVersion : 'Windows 7' AgentNameVersion : 'Chrome 100.0.4896.75'",

The GraphQl library currently used has problems with dynamically creating the Schema (see also: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-graphql/issues/452 ). Base query The base query for analyzing a User-Agent with everything on it looks like this:\nquery { analyze(requestHeaders: { userAgent : \"Mozilla\\/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit\\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\\/103.0.0.0 Safari\\/537.36\" secChUa : \"\\\".Not\\/A)Brand\\\";v=\\\"99\\\", \\\"Google Chrome\\\";v=\\\"103\\\", \\\"Chromium\\\";v=\\\"103\\\"\" secChUaArch : \"\\\"x86\\\"\" secChUaBitness : \"\\\"64\\\"\" secChUaFullVersion : \"\\\"103.0.5060.134\\\"\" secChUaFullVersionList : \"\\\".Not\\/A)Brand\\\";v=\\\"99.0.0.0\\\", \\\"Google Chrome\\\";v=\\\"103.0.5060.134\\\", \\\"Chromium\\\";v=\\\"103.0.5060.134\\\"\" secChUaMobile : \"?0\" secChUaModel : \"\\\"\\\"\" secChUaPlatform : \"\\\"Linux\\\"\" secChUaPlatformVersion : \"\\\"5.13.0\\\"\" secChUaWoW64 : \"?0\" }) { deviceClass deviceName deviceBrand deviceCpu deviceCpuBits deviceFirmwareVersion deviceVersion operatingSystemClass operatingSystemName operatingSystemVersion operatingSystemVersionMajor operatingSystemNameVersion operatingSystemNameVersionMajor layoutEngineClass layoutEngineName layoutEngineVersion layoutEngineVersionMajor layoutEngineNameVersion layoutEngineNameVersionMajor agentClass agentName agentVersion agentVersionMajor agentNameVersion agentNameVersionMajor remarkablePattern } } which results in\n{ \"data\": { \"analyze\": { \"deviceClass\": \"Desktop\", \"deviceName\": \"Linux Desktop\", \"deviceBrand\": \"Unknown\", \"deviceCpu\": \"Intel x86_64\", \"deviceCpuBits\": \"64\", \"operatingSystemClass\": \"Desktop\", \"operatingSystemName\": \"Linux\", \"operatingSystemVersion\": \"5.13.0\", \"operatingSystemVersionMajor\": \"5\", \"operatingSystemNameVersion\": \"Linux 5.13.0\", \"operatingSystemNameVersionMajor\": \"Linux 5\", \"layoutEngineClass\": \"Browser\", \"layoutEngineName\": \"Blink\", \"layoutEngineVersion\": \"103.0\", \"layoutEngineVersionMajor\": \"103\", \"layoutEngineNameVersion\": \"Blink 103.0\", \"layoutEngineNameVersionMajor\": \"Blink 103\", \"agentClass\": \"Browser\", \"agentName\": \"Chrome\", \"agentVersion\": \"103.0.5060.134\", \"agentVersionMajor\": \"103\", \"agentNameVersion\": \"Chrome 103.0.5060.134\", \"agentNameVersionMajor\": \"Chrome 103\", \"remarkablePattern\": \"Unknown\" } } } Accessing all (including custom) fields To get to all the other fields you can simply ask for all of them:\n{ analyze(requestHeaders: { userAgent: \"TestApplication/1.2.3 (node123.datacenter.example.nl;

    "content": "Introduction This is a User Defined Function for Apache Beam\nGetting the UDF You can get the prebuilt UDF from maven central.\nIf you use a maven based project simply add this dependency to your project.\n\u003cdependency\u003e \u003cgroupId\u003enl.basjes.parse.useragent\u003c/groupId\u003e \u003cartifactId\u003eyauaa-beam\u003c/artifactId\u003e \u003cversion\u003e7.28.1\u003c/version\u003e \u003c/dependency\u003e Usage Assume you have a PCollection with your records. In most cases I see (clickstream data) these records (In this example this class is called “TestRecord”) contain the useragent string in a field and the parsed results must be added to these fields.\nNow you must do two things:\nDetermine the names of the fields you need. Add an instance of the (abstract) UserAgentAnalysisDoFn function and implement the functions as shown in the example below. Use the YauaaField annotation to get the setter for the requested fields. Note that the name of the setters is not important, the system looks at the annotation.\nExample: Only User-Agent .apply(\"Extract Elements from Useragent and Client Hints\", ParDo.of(new UserAgentAnalysisDoFn\u003cTestRecord\u003e(15000) { // Setting the cacheSize @Override public String getUserAgentString(TestRecord record) { return record.useragent; } @SuppressWarnings(\"unused\") // Called via the annotation @YauaaField(\"DeviceClass\") public void setDC(TestRecord record, String value) { record.deviceClass = value; } @SuppressWarnings(\"unused\") // Called via the annotation @YauaaField(\"AgentNameVersion\") public void setANV(TestRecord record, String value) { record.agentNameVersion = value; } @SuppressWarnings(\"unused\") // Called via the annotation @YauaaField(\"OperatingSystemNameVersion\") public void setOSNV(TestRecord record, String value) { record.operatingSystemNameVersion = value; } }) ) Example: User-Agent Client Hints The only difference with the “Only User-Agent” implementation is that the getRequestHeaders is overridden. The resulting map should have the original request header names as keys and the actual header value as the value.\nTo illustrate:\nMap\u003cString, String\u003e requestHeaders = new TreeMap\u003c\u003e(); requestHeaders.put(\"User-Agent\", \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua\", \"\\\" Not A;Brand\\\";v=\\\"99\\\", \\\"Chromium\\\";v=\\\"100\\\", \\\"Google Chrome\\\";v=\\\"100\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Arch\", \"\\\"x86\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Full-Version-List\", \"\\\" Not A;Brand\\\";v=\\\"99.0.0.0\\\", \\\"Chromium\\\";v=\\\"100.0.4896.75\\\", \\\"Google Chrome\\\";v=\\\"100.0.4896.75\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile\", \"?0\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Model\", \"\\\"\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform\", \"\\\"Windows\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform-Version\", \"\\\"0.1.0\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Wow64\", \"?0\"); Using the analyzer whould then be something like this:\n.apply(\"Extract Elements from Useragent and Client Hints\", ParDo.of(new UserAgentAnalysisDoFn\u003cTestRecord\u003e(15000) { // Setting the cacheSize @Override public Map\u003cString, String\u003e getRequestHeaders(TestRecord element) { return element.getHeaders(); } @SuppressWarnings(\"unused\") // Called via the annotation @YauaaField(\"DeviceClass\") public void setDC(TestRecord record, String value) { record.deviceClass = value; } @SuppressWarnings(\"unused\") // Called via the annotation @YauaaField(\"AgentNameVersion\") public void setANV(TestRecord record, String value) { record.agentNameVersion = value; } @SuppressWarnings(\"unused\") // Called via the annotation @YauaaField(\"OperatingSystemNameVersion\") public void setOSNV(TestRecord record, String value) { record.operatingSystemNameVersion = value; } }) ) Immutable instances in Apache Beam Apache Beam requires a DoFn to never modify the provided instance and to always return a new instance that is then passed to the next processing step. To handle this in a generic way UserAgentAnalysisDoFn has a “clone” method that does this by means of doing a round trip through serialization.

It does make the returned set smaller and thus in terms of transport and serialization a bit faster.\nIf you als want the client hints all of these parameters can be combined like this:\nParseUserAgent( 'user-Agent', userAgent, 'sec-CH-UA-Platform', chPlatform, 'sec-CH-UA-Platform-Version', chPlatformVersion 'DeviceClass', 'AgentNameVersionMajor', 'OperatingSystemNameVersion', ) which is equivalent to (i.e. the ordering of the “wanted fields” and the “request headers with value” can be shuffled):\nParseUserAgent( 'DeviceClass', 'user-Agent', userAgent, 'AgentNameVersionMajor', 'sec-CH-UA-Platform', chPlatform, 'OperatingSystemNameVersion', 'sec-CH-UA-Platform-Version', chPlatformVersion ) Getting several values as JSon Assuming the input\nMozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0; Nexus 6 Build/NBD90Z) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/53.0.2785.124 Mobile Safari/537.36 To parse this input value into all possible values and returns the complete result as a single JSon string use this:\nParseUserAgentJson(userAgent) to give (single line)\n{\"Useragent\":\"Mozilla\\/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0; Nexus 6 Build\\/NBD90Z) AppleWebKit\\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\\/53.0.2785.124 Mobile Safari\\/537.36\", \"DeviceClass\":\"Phone\",\"DeviceName\":\"Google Nexus 6\",\"DeviceBrand\":\"Google\", \"OperatingSystemClass\":\"Mobile\",\"OperatingSystemName\":\"Android\",\"OperatingSystemVersion\":\"7.0\",\"OperatingSystemVersionMajor\":\"7\",\"OperatingSystemNameVersion\":\"Android 7.0\",\"OperatingSystemNameVersionMajor\":\"Android 7\",\"OperatingSystemVersionBuild\":\"NBD90Z\", \"LayoutEngineClass\":\"Browser\",\"LayoutEngineName\":\"Blink\",\"LayoutEngineVersion\":\"53.0\",\"LayoutEngineVersionMajor\":\"53\",\"LayoutEngineNameVersion\":\"Blink 53.0\",\"LayoutEngineNameVersionMajor\":\"Blink 53\", \"AgentClass\":\"Browser\",\"AgentName\":\"Chrome\",\"AgentVersion\":\"53.0.2785.124\",\"AgentVersionMajor\":\"53\",\"AgentNameVersion\":\"Chrome 53.0.2785.124\",\"AgentNameVersionMajor\":\"Chrome 53\"} To get a JSon with only specific fields you can do (up to 10 fields van be requested this way)\nParseUserAgentJson(userAgent, 'DeviceClass', 'AgentNameVersion') to give\n{\"DeviceClass\":\"Phone\",\"AgentNameVersion\":\"Chrome 53.0.2785.124\"} Note that the Client Hints model also applies here so this works too:\nParseUserAgentJson( 'DeviceClass', 'user-Agent', userAgent, 'AgentNameVersionMajor', 'sec-CH-UA-Platform', chPlatform, 'OperatingSystemNameVersion', 'sec-CH-UA-Platform-Version', chPlatformVersion ) Example usage Assume you have a PCollection with your records.\nPCollection\u003cRow\u003e input = ...

In most cases I see (clickstream data) these records (In this example this class is called “TestRecord”) contain the useragent string in a field and the parsed results must be added to these fields.\nNow you must do two things:\nDetermine the names of the fields you need. Add an instance of the (abstract) UserAgentAnalysisMapper mapper and implement the functions as shown in the example below. Use the Field annotation to get the setter for the requested fields. Note that the name of the setters is not important, the system looks at the annotation.\nExample: Only User-Agent .map(new UserAgentAnalysisMapper\u003cTestRecord\u003e(15000) { // Setting the cacheSize @Override public String getUserAgentString(TestRecord record) { return record.useragent; } @SuppressWarnings(\"unused\") // Called via the annotation @YauaaField(\"DeviceClass\") public void setDC(TestRecord record, String value) { record.deviceClass = value; } @SuppressWarnings(\"unused\") // Called via the annotation @YauaaField(\"AgentNameVersion\") public void setANV(TestRecord record, String value) { record.agentNameVersion = value; } @SuppressWarnings(\"unused\") // Called via the annotation @YauaaField(\"OperatingSystemNameVersion\") public void setOSNV(TestRecord record, String value) { record.operatingSystemNameVersion = value; } }) Example: User-Agent Client Hints The only difference with the “Only User-Agent” implementation is that the getRequestHeaders is overridden. The resulting map should have the original request header names as keys and the actual header value as the value.\nTo illustrate:\nMap\u003cString, String\u003e requestHeaders = new TreeMap\u003c\u003e(); requestHeaders.put(\"User-Agent\", \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua\", \"\\\" Not A;Brand\\\";v=\\\"99\\\", \\\"Chromium\\\";v=\\\"100\\\", \\\"Google Chrome\\\";v=\\\"100\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Arch\", \"\\\"x86\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Full-Version-List\", \"\\\" Not A;Brand\\\";v=\\\"99.0.0.0\\\", \\\"Chromium\\\";v=\\\"100.0.4896.75\\\", \\\"Google Chrome\\\";v=\\\"100.0.4896.75\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile\", \"?0\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Model\", \"\\\"\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform\", \"\\\"Windows\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform-Version\", \"\\\"0.1.0\\\"\"); requestHeaders.put(\"Sec-Ch-Ua-Wow64\", \"?0\"); Using the analyzer whould then be something like this:\n.map(new UserAgentAnalysisMapper\u003cTestRecord\u003e(15000) { // Setting the cacheSize @Override public Map\u003cString, String\u003e getRequestHeaders(TestRecord element) { return element.getHeaders(); } @SuppressWarnings(\"unused\") // Called via the annotation @YauaaField(\"DeviceClass\") public void setDC(TestRecord record, String value) { record.deviceClass = value; } @SuppressWarnings(\"unused\") // Called via the annotation @YauaaField(\"AgentNameVersion\") public void setANV(TestRecord record, String value) { record.agentNameVersion = value; } @SuppressWarnings(\"unused\") // Called via the annotation @YauaaField(\"OperatingSystemNameVersion\") public void setOSNV(TestRecord record, String value) { record.operatingSystemNameVersion = value; } }) NOTES on defining it as an anonymous class An anonymous inner class in Java is by default private.\nIf you define it as an anonymous inner class as shown above then the system will try to make this class to become public by means of the method .setAccessible(true).

All possible fields [ \"DeviceClass\", \"DeviceBrand\", \"DeviceName\", \"AgentNameVersionMajor\" ] cacheSize O The number of entries in the LRU cache of the parser 10000 100 preheat O How many testcases are put through the parser at startup to warmup the JVM 0 1000 extraRules O A yaml expression that is a set of extra rules and testcases. - \"config:\\n- matcher:\\n extract:\\n - '\"'\"'FirstProductName : 1 :agent.(1)product.(1)name'\"'\"'\\n\" Example usage Basic pipeline Create a pipeline that just extracts everything using the default settings:\ncurl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT 'localhost:9200/_ingest/pipeline/yauaa-test-pipeline_basic' -d ' { \"description\": \"A pipeline to do whatever\", \"processors\": [ { \"yauaa\" : { \"field_to_header_mapping\" : { \"useragent\": \"User-Agent\", \"uach_platform\": \"Sec-CH-UA-Platform\", \"uach_platform_version\": \"Sec-CH-UA-Platform-Version\" }, \"target_field\" : \"parsed\" } } ] } ' Common pipeline In this example a pipeline is created that only gets the fields that are actually desired.\ncurl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT 'localhost:9200/_ingest/pipeline/yauaa-test-pipeline_some' -d ' { \"description\": \"A pipeline to do whatever\", \"processors\": [ { \"yauaa\" : { \"field_to_header_mapping\" : { \"useragent\": \"User-Agent\", \"uach_platform\": \"Sec-CH-UA-Platform\", \"uach_platform_version\": \"Sec-CH-UA-Platform-Version\" }, \"target_field\" : \"parsed\", \"fieldNames\" : [ \"DeviceClass\", \"DeviceBrand\", \"DeviceName\", \"AgentNameVersionMajor\", \"FirstProductName\" ], } } ] } ' Advanced pipeline In this example a pipeline is created that includes an example of a custom rule.

This means that I have chosen to no longer let the build fail if you do not have Java 22 installed.
