# Many brands (like the Oppo example below) have device IDs that are for a large part completely random
# and have no pattern to easily classify them.
# So I choose NOT to include all of them; there are simply too many and also many overlap with
# device ids of other brands.
# https://yauaa.basjes.nl/expect/limitations/#device-name-and-device-brand
# The example below would normally result in: DeviceBrand : 'Unknown'

# Since 7.9.0 you can extend an existing lookup so this allows for adding extra tag
# prefixes that are then mapped to a brand.
# This allows users to maintain their own list of all device tags they find important.
# This is just a quick demonstration to show this can work.

# NOTE to self: This must remain working for others.
