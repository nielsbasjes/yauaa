This is a java library that tries to parse and analyze the useragent string and extract as many relevant attributes as possible.

The full documentation can be found here [https://yauaa.basjes.nl](https://yauaa.basjes.nl)

HIGH Profile release notes:
===========================

Version 5.8
---
The detection for Microsoft Edge now no longer reports the 'EdgeHtml' version as if it is the version of 'Edge' itself. Microsoft made a mess of things again.

Version 5.6
---
In version 5.6 the number of detected DeviceBrands is greatly increased.
The detection system for the DeviceBrand has been rewritten and as a consequence both the memory usage and the time needed for the analysis have been decreased.

Version 5.5
---
With Google Chrome 70 the useragent string pattern has been changed on Android ( https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4558585463832576 ) .
As a consequence the detection of the DeviceBrand failed and you always get "Unknown". 
This has been fixed in Yauaa 5.5.

Version 5.1 is bad.
---
If you are using version 5.1 you should upgrade IMMEDIATELY because 5.1 crashes over specific useragent patterns caused by a simple packaging mistake.

    Mozilla/1.2.3 (http://basjes.nl)

Blog post 
=========
A bit more background about this useragent parser can be found in this blog which I wrote about it: [https://techlab.bol.com/making-sense-user-agent-string/](https://partnerprogramma.bol.com/click/click?p=1&t=url&s=2171&f=TXL&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechlab.bol.com%2Fmaking-sense-user-agent-string%2F&name=yauaa)

Example output

**NOTES**

1. This runs under a "Free quota" on Google AppEngine. If this quota is exceeded then it will simply become unavailable for that day.
2. After a while of inactivity the instance is terminated so the first page may take 15-30 seconds to load.
3. If you really like this then run it on your local systems. It's much faster that way.
