# Yauaa: Yet Another UserAgent Analyzer
This is a java library that tries to parse and analyze the useragent string (and when available the User-Agent Client Hints) and extract as many relevant attributes as possible.

Works with Java, Scala, Kotlin and provides ready for use UDFs for several processing systems.
