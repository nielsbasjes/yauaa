# Yauaa: Yet Another UserAgent Analyzer
This is a java library that tries to parse and analyze the useragent string (and when available the User-Agent Client Hints) and extract as many relevant attributes as possible.

Works with Java, Scala, Kotlin and provides ready for use UDFs for several processing systems.

The full documentation can be found here [https://yauaa.basjes.nl](https://yauaa.basjes.nl)

## ALL USERS OF THE CLIENTHINTS ANALYSIS FEATURE ARE URGED TO UPDATE TO 7.9.0
In a specific case of bad data in the Client Hints yauaa 7.0.0-7.8.0 will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

See [Security Advisory: CVE-2022-23496](https://github.com/nielsbasjes/yauaa/security/advisories/GHSA-c4pm-63cg-9j7h)

       - Fixes OSGI problems https://github.com/apache/unomi/pull/557
- New/improved detections
    - NULL version is now assumes to be caused by broken plugins instead of Robot.

### Version 7.11.0

## Regarding the recent Log4J2 issues
The Yauaa analyzer uses the Log4J2 API to do the logging and through the included dependencies also JCL is needed to run.

TL;DR:
- **The core of Yauaa is safe** as it does not include any logging dependencies and expects the application to provide everything.
- **In normal operations user input is not logged**.
- The **Snowflake UDF is affected** by these problems (due to shading the dependencies in).

### NO batteries included
By design the Yauaa library expects the application in which it is used to provide the actual logging dependencies and configuration.
If you do not provide the needed logging classes it will simply fail at startup.

So by design the Yauaa library expects all of these frameworks to be provided (and configured) and does not include any of them or any configuration for them.

This is true for most of the released artifacts (including the base library) except for the Snowflake UDF which does include almost all dependencies.
So the Snowflake UDF IS affected by this issue and all users are recommended to update.

### Minimal logging
Note that Yauaa does not log any user input and/or analysis results from user input during normal operation.
Only during development and during unit tests the Useragents are logged.

This is because it was designed to run in very large scale batch and streaming situations (very large as in "Let's analyze these 10^10 records").

### Bring your own batteries
To assist in running Yauaa without the logj4-core jar an example was created that only uses SLF4J: [here](https://github.com/nielsbasjes/yauaa/tree/main/analyzer/src/it/Examples/java-slf4j).
