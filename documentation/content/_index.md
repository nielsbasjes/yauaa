This is a java library that tries to parse and analyze the useragent string (and when available the User-Agent Client Hints) and extract as many relevant attributes as possible.

Works with Java, Scala, Kotlin and provides ready for use UDFs for several processing systems.

The full documentation can be found here [https://yauaa.basjes.nl](https://yauaa.basjes.nl)

If you just want to give it a quick try then you can do that with your own browser here: [https://try.yauaa.basjes.nl/](https://try.yauaa.basjes.nl/) (runs on a very slow and rate limited machine).

## Significant change happened in Apple iPads
Since about February 2025 the Apple iPads no longer are reported as a Tablet because their useragent has switched to reporting a Desktop:

A known device which was previously reporting these useragents

    Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; CPU OS 18_3 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/15E148
    Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; CPU OS 18_3_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko)

is now reporting this one

    Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/18.0 Safari/605.1.15

This last one is identical to an Apple Mac Desktop and this makes it impossible to determine that this is really a Tablet.

Currently (April 2025) it seems that this effect is different depending on the used browser. Browsers like Chrome, Edge, Opera, Aloha and Yandex still report `iPad Tablet`, but browsers like Safari, Brave, Firefox, DuckDuckGo and Arc Search report `MacOS Desktop`

## License
I'm publishing this under the Apache 2.0 license because I believe it is the best way to make these kinds of projects available to the world.

But do not underestimate how much work went into this. I have spent over a decade tuning this project to what you have now.

All I want to see in return is a little bit of gratitude from the people who use this.
If you are a home user/hobbyist/small business then a simple star on the project is enough for me. Seeing that people use and like the things I create is what I'm doing this for.
What also really helps are bug reports, headers from real/new devices/browsers that I have net yet seen before and discussions on things you think can be done better.

Despite there not being any obligation (because of the Apache 2.0 license); If you are a big corporation where my code really adds value to the products you make/sell then I would really appreciate it if you could do a small sponsor thing. Buy me lunch (€10), Buy me a game (€100) or what ever you think is the right way to say thank you for the work I have done.

[![If this project has business value for you then don't hesitate to support me with a small donation.](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sponsor%20me-via%20Github-darkgreen.svg)](https://github.com/sponsors/nielsbasjes)
