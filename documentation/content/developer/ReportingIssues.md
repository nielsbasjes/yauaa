## Introduction
All software has bugs and things that it should do better.

Yauaa is no exception; there are bugs, inaccuracies and there is lots of room for improvement.

So if you find something please report it via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nielsbasjes/yauaa/issues).

However...

## These are not bugs
I get quite a few bug reports and questions that Yauaa is not extracting the right version number from the provided User-Agent.

### Key thing to know
There are so many [manipulations and lies]({{% relref "expect/Manipulations.md" %}}) in the `User-Agent`s that simply looking at the User-Agent will yield the wrong answer.
Yauaa will try to give the best possible answer and some classes of lies are reported as such.

**So in addition to simply looking at the `User-Agent` it will also overrule these values if a documented manipulations is detected.**

**Most incorrect reports are about** a Chromium/Chrome/Edge/... browser that shows `??` as the version of the Operating System but just looking at it you can clearly read a version. The Chromium team have clearly documented that they are removing information from the `User-Agent` header and replace parts with fixed values that are almost meaningless.

See: https://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction/


### Frozen Windows versions

Take for example this User-Agent:

    Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.0.0 Safari/537.36

Most people expect to get

    OperatingSystemNameVersion           : 'Windows 10.0'
    AgentNameVersion                     : 'Chrome 100.0.0.0'

but instead they get

    OperatingSystemNameVersion           : 'Windows NT ??'
    AgentNameVersion                     : 'Chrome 100'

and then report that as a bug.

**This is not a bug.**

This example was recorded on a `Windows 7` system and there is nothing in the `User-Agent` to extract this anymore.

### Frozen Android version
A similar effect is with

    Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/113.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36

Most people expect to get

    OperatingSystemNameVersion           : 'Android 10'

but instead they get

    OperatingSystemNameVersion           : 'Android ??'

Again: **This is not a bug.**

This example was recorded on an `Android 11` system and there is nothing in the `User-Agent` to extract this anymore.

## Your best workaround

At this point in time (mid 2022) the best way around much of these [manipulations and lies]({{% relref "expect/Manipulations.md" %}}) is by asking for and recording the [User-Agent Client Hints]({{% relref "using/ClientHints.md" %}}) on your website.

If you ask for these User-Agent Client Hints you can get something like these extra request headers in addition to the `User-Agent` from the browser.

| Header                      | Value                                                                                        |
|:----------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sec-Ch-Ua                   | " Not A;Brand";v="99", "Chromium";v="100", "Google Chrome";v="100"                           |
| Sec-Ch-Ua-Arch              | "x86"                                                                                        |
| Sec-Ch-Ua-Full-Version-List | " Not A;Brand";v="99.0.0.0", "Chromium";v="100.0.4896.75", "Google Chrome";v="100.0.4896.75" |
| Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile            | ?0                                                                                           |
| Sec-Ch-Ua-Model             | ""                                                                                           |
| Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform          | "Windows"                                                                                    |
| Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform-Version  | "0.1.0"                                                                                      |
| Sec-Ch-Ua-Wow64             | ?0                                                                                           |

With all of this extra information Yauaa can now correctly report the above mentioned Windows 7 example as:

    OperatingSystemNameVersion           : 'Windows 7'
    AgentNameVersion                     : 'Chrome 100.0.4896.75'
